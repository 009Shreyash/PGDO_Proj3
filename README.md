Objective: Demonstrate the continuous integration and delivery by building a Docker Jenkins Pipeline.  </br>

Solution build should demonstrate below capabilities:  </br>
•	Availability of the application and its versions in the GitHub </br>
•	Track their versions every time a code is committed to the repository  </br>
•	Create a Docker Jenkins Pipeline that will create a Docker image from the Dockerfile and host it on Docker Hub  </br>
•	It should also pull the Docker image and run it as a Docker container  </br>
•	Build the Docker Jenkins Pipeline to demonstrate the continuous integration and continuous delivery workflow  </br>
